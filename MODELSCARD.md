# Model card

## Project context

The model card documents a Python application developed for building and training machine learning models using data scraped from the ImmoWeb property listing website. The goal of the project is to predict property prices based on features extracted from the listings.

## Data

The input dataset consists of property listing data scraped from ImmoWeb, containing various features such as property size, location, number of rooms, etc. The target variable is the property price.

## Model details

Three different models are tested in the application:
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
- Random Forest Regressor

These models are trained using default parameters for each respective algorithm.

## Performance

Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared value are used to evaluate the models. The evaluation results are stored and can be accessed in the event_log.csv file.

| Model                         | Mean Squared Error | R-squared value |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Linear Regression             | {{ latest_metrics["Linear Regression"]["Mean Squared Error"] }} | {{ latest_metrics["Linear Regression"]["R-squared value"] }} |
| Gradient Boosted Decision Tree| {{ latest_metrics["Gradient Boosted Decision Tree"]["Mean Squared Error"] }} | {{ latest_metrics["Gradient Boosted Decision Tree"]["R-squared value"] }} |
| Random Forest Regressor       | {{ latest_metrics["Random Forest Regressor"]["Mean Squared Error"] }} | {{ latest_metrics["Random Forest Regressor"]["R-squared value"] }} |

## Limitations

One limitation of the models is potential biases in the data, such as geographical biases, which may affect the accuracy of the predictions. Additionally, ethical considerations related to privacy should be taken into account when using scraped data from real estate listings.

## Usage

Dependencies for running the application include libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The main scripts in the application are:
- `models.py`: Contains functions to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions used in data preprocessing and model training.

To train the model, users can execute the `main.py` script. Predictions can be generated by calling the appropriate functions in the `models.py` script.
